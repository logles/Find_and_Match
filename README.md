# Project 1: Card Matching Game

* In this project you will see a Card Matching Game. 

## Rules

* Flip over 2 cards, if they match they will disappear.

* Match all pairs to win!

* You have to decide between the 3 Difficulty Levels!

## Specification in HTML

* We made a <Class ID> for the Game Information: A list to display the game information, such as the difficulty, number of attempts, and the last high score.

* We created another <class ID> for the Cards: 18 cards are laid out in the game area

* Build a Modal Pop out

* We were able to Get cards to flip over when you click on them

* Build Difficulty drop down/logic

* We were able to provide two distinct UI elements

## Specifications in JS

* Created a function to shuffle the cards upon page reset

* Created a function which flips a card when it is clicked on

* Created a function which keeps track of the number of attempts the user has made

* Create a function which recognizes when a pair is found and hides the found pair

* //TODO: Create a function which recognizes when the user has won and logs the user's score in local memory

## PageElements.JS

* When a button in the difficulty Menu is clicked, it displays cards based on the chosen difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and sets the chosenDifficulty variable accordingly.

## CSS

* Inside the CSS you will find the Card-style for the cards to be able to be flipped and for them to be organized 

* In the CSS inside the assests you will find the 9 Images for the matching card game
